## Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL)

**Information**

Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a chronic, contagious disease of cattle caused by a retrovirus called bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). BLV is a cancer-causing virus that can infect cattle of all ages.

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of EBL can vary depending on the animal's individual immune response. Some infected cattle may show no symptoms at all, while others may develop a range of symptoms, including:

* Weight loss
* Enlarged lymph nodes
* Anemia
* Jaundice
* Reduced milk production
* Cancerous tumors

**Remedies**

There is no cure for EBL. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Administering fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections
* Administering antibiotics

**Causes**

EBL is caused by a retrovirus called bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). BLV is a cancer-causing virus that can infect cattle of all ages. BLV is spread through contact with infected cattle's blood or milk.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for EBL. However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Testing cattle for BLV infection
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Practicing good hygiene and biosecurity measures
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus
