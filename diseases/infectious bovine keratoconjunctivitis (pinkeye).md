It is caused by the bacterium Moraxella bovis. IBK can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including inflammation of the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelids, and discharge from the eyes. In some cases, IBK can also lead to blindness.

**Remedies:**

* IBK can be treated with antibiotics, such as penicillin or tetracycline.
* Treatment may take several weeks.
* Animals that have been diagnosed with IBK should be isolated from other animals to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Causes:**

* IBK is caused by the bacterium Moraxella bovis.
* This bacterium is found in the environment, and it can enter the eye of an animal through contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids.
* IBK can also spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as water troughs or feed buckets.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent IBK is to keep animals healthy and well-groomed.
