## Hardware disease

**Information:** Hardware disease, also known as traumatic reticuloperitonitis, is a condition that affects cattle when they ingest sharp objects, such as nails, wire, or pieces of metal. The object can puncture the reticulum, a part of the stomach, and cause infection.

**Symptoms:**

* Depression
* Weight loss
* Loss of appetite
* Fever
* Coughing
* Difficulty breathing
* Bloating
* Pain in the abdomen
* Lump in the abdomen

**Remedies:**

* Hardware disease is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
* Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the object and antibiotics to treat the infection.
* The cow may also need fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.
* In severe cases, the cow may need to be hospitalized.

**Causes:**

* Hardware disease is caused when cattle ingest sharp objects, such as nails, wire, or pieces of metal.
* These objects can puncture the reticulum, a part of the stomach, and cause infection.
* The infection can then spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lungs, and heart.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent hardware disease is to keep cattle's feed and water sources free of sharp objects.
* Animals should also be monitored for signs of the disease, such as depression, weight loss, and loss of appetite.
* If an animal is suspected of having hardware disease, it should be taken to a veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
