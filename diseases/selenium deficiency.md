## Selenium deficiency

**Information:** Selenium is an essential trace mineral for cattle. It is involved in many important functions in the body, including reproduction, immune function, and muscle function.

**Symptoms:**

* Reproductive problems, such as abortion, stillbirth, and weak calves
* Poor growth
* Muscle weakness
* Lameness
* White muscle disease
* Ketosis
* Mastitis
* Reduced fertility
* Death

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for selenium deficiency.
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Feeding selenium-rich supplements
    * Treating other underlying conditions

**Causes:**

* Selenium deficiency is caused by a lack of selenium in the diet.
* Selenium is found in soil, and areas with low selenium levels in the soil are more likely to have cattle with selenium deficiency.
* Cattle can also become deficient in selenium if they are fed grain that has been grown in low-selenium soil.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent selenium deficiency is to feed cattle a diet that is selenium-rich.
* Selenium supplements are also available.
* Cattle that are at risk of selenium deficiency, such as those that are grazing in low-selenium areas, should be supplemented with selenium.
