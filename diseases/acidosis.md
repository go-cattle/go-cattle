## Acidosis

**Information:** Acidosis is a metabolic disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by a buildup of acids in the blood. Acids are produced when the body breaks down carbohydrates for energy.

**Symptoms:**

* Loss of appetite
* Weight loss
* Depression
* Drooling
* Increased thirst
* Increased urination
* Weakness
* Difficulty breathing
* Pale mucous membranes
* Accumulation of ketones in the urine

**Remedies:**

* Acidosis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
* Treatment usually involves fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.
* The cow may also need to be given an injection of bicarbonate to neutralize the acids.
* In severe cases, the cow may need to be hospitalized.

**Causes:**

* Acidosis is caused by a buildup of acids in the blood. Acids are produced when the body breaks down carbohydrates for energy.
* This can happen for a number of reasons, including:
    * **Diet:** A diet that is too high in grain can lead to acidosis.
    * **Stress:** Stress can also lead to acidosis.
    * **Lactation:** Lactating cows are more likely to develop acidosis because they need more energy to produce milk.
    * **Pregnancy:** Pregnant cows are also more likely to develop acidosis because they need more energy to support the growth of the fetus.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent acidosis is to feed cattle a diet that is balanced in carbohydrates and fiber.
* Cattle should also be provided with plenty of fresh water.
* Stress should be minimized.
* Lactating cows should be fed a diet that is high in energy and fiber.
* Pregnant cows should be fed a diet that is high in energy and protein.
* Animals should be monitored for signs of acidosis, such as loss of appetite, weight loss, and depression.
* If an animal is suspected of having acidosis, it should be taken to a veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
