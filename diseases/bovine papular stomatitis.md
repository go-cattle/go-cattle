## Bovine papular stomatitis

**Information** : Bovine papular stomatitis is a viral disease that causes raised, red lesions on the mouth and muzzle of cattle. It is caused by a virus called bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV), which is a member of the parapoxvirus family.

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of bovine papular stomatitis typically appear within 2-3 weeks of infection and include:

* Raised, red lesions on the mouth and muzzle
* Painful eating and drinking
* Drooling
* Fever
* Swelling of the lymph nodes in the head and neck

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for bovine papular stomatitis. Treatment is typically supportive and may include:

* Providing pain relief
* Administering fluids
* Treating secondary bacterial infections

**Causes**

Bovine papular stomatitis is caused by a virus called bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV), which is a member of the parapoxvirus family. BPSV is spread through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as feed, water, or equipment.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for bovine papular stomatitis. However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Practicing good biosecurity measures
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus

**Differential diagnosis**

Bovine papular stomatitis can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that cause mouth lesions, such as foot-and-mouth disease, contagious ecthyma, and vesicular stomatitis. A veterinarian can diagnose bovine papular stomatitis by testing a sample of the lesions for the presence of BPSV.
