## Bluetongue

**Information:** Bluetongue is a viral disease that affects ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. It is caused by a virus called bluetongue virus (BTV), which is transmitted by biting midges. Bluetongue can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including fever, swelling of the tongue and lips, lameness, and skin lesions. In some cases, bluetongue can be fatal.

**Symptoms:**

* Fever
* Swelling of the tongue and lips
* Lameness
* Skin lesions
* Depression
* Inappetence
* Jaundice
* Difficulty breathing
* Death

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific treatment for bluetongue.
* Animals that are diagnosed with bluetongue should be treated symptomatically, such as with fluids and antibiotics.
* Animals that have recovered from bluetongue may be immune to future infection.

**Causes:**

* Bluetongue is caused by a virus called bluetongue virus (BTV).
* This virus is transmitted by biting midges.
* The midges become infected with BTV when they feed on an infected animal.
* They then transmit the virus to other animals when they feed on them.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent bluetongue is to control midge populations.
* This can be done by using insecticides to treat pastures and livestock, and by removing standing water where midges breed.
* Animals can also be vaccinated against bluetongue.

**Vaccination:**

* There are a number of vaccines available for bluetongue.
* Vaccinations are typically given to young animals at a few months of age and then every year or two thereafter.
* Vaccination is not always effective, and animals that are vaccinated may still become infected with bluetongue.

**Other preventive measures:**

* Avoid grazing animals in areas where bluetongue is known to be present.
* Promptly treat any wounds or abrasions on animals.
* Disposing of dead animals properly to prevent the spread of the disease.
