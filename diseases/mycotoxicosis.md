## Mycotoxicosis

**Information:** Mycotoxicosis is a disease caused by the consumption of feed or forage contaminated with mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are poisonous substances produced by fungi, which can grow on a variety of crops, including corn, wheat, and hay.

**Symptoms:**

* The symptoms of mycotoxicosis can vary depending on the type of mycotoxin ingested, the amount ingested, and the animal's individual susceptibility. Some common symptoms include:
    * Loss of appetite
    * Weight loss
    * Diarrhea
    * Vomiting
    * Jaundice
    * Impaired reproduction
    * Death

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific treatment for mycotoxicosis. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Administering activated charcoal to absorb the mycotoxin
    * Providing fluids and electrolytes
    * Treating other underlying conditions

**Causes:**

* Mycotoxicosis is caused by the consumption of feed or forage contaminated with mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are produced by fungi, which can grow on a variety of crops, including corn, wheat, and hay.
* Mycotoxins can be produced in the field, during storage, or during processing of feed and forage.
* The risk of mycotoxicosis is increased in warm, humid conditions.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent mycotoxicosis is to:
    * Feed cattle a balanced diet
    * Store feed and forage properly
    * Test feed and forage for mycotoxins
    * Use mycotoxin binders to reduce the absorption of mycotoxins
