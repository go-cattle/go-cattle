## Blackleg

**Information:** Blackleg, also known as quarter ill or symptomatic anthrax, is a bacterial disease that affects cattle, sheep, and other ruminants. It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium chauvoei, which is a spore-forming bacteria that can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Blackleg is a highly fatal disease, and death can occur within hours of the onset of symptoms.

**Symptoms:**

* Sudden onset of fever
* Depression
* Swelling of muscles, especially in the hindquarters and shoulders
* The affected muscles may become black and necrotic
* The animal may have difficulty breathing or walking
* Death may occur within hours of the onset of symptoms

**Remedies:**

* There is no effective treatment for blackleg.
* Animals that are diagnosed with blackleg should be euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Causes:**

* Blackleg is caused by the bacterium Clostridium chauvoei.
* This bacterium is found in soil and water.
* Animals become infected with blackleg when they ingest or inhale the spores.
* The spores can also enter the body through wounds or abrasions.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent blackleg is to vaccinate animals against the disease.
* Vaccinations are typically given to young animals at a few months of age and then every year or two thereafter.
* Other preventive measures include:
    * Avoiding grazing animals in areas where blackleg is known to be present
    * Promptly treating any wounds or abrasions on animals
    * Disposing of dead animals properly to prevent the spread of the disease
